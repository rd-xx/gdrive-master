# To-do

Should ask for the web API key after executing the app for the first time. We ask for it because when we're done creating the keys, we'll automatically add them to a database.

There will be 2 modes: semi-automated and fully automated.

- [ ] Semi-automated setup : create a service account and keys on demand. Send everything to the web API.
- [ ] Fully automated : create 1 service account and 100 keys. Send everything to the web API.
